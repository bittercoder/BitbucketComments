DevDefined.Bitbucket.MMBot
==========================

A Simple MMBot script which will scan bitbucket and return details of any new comments or updated comments since the last scan.

Currently out of the box it will look back 120 commits only.  In the future I might make this configurable.

Implementation relies on the WebAPI Client.
